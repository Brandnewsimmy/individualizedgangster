# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** Before the Feds got here.

## 1. The "I Was Never Here" Clause
All consultations are theoretical. If you get caught, I do not know you. If you mention my name in an interrogation room, I will sue you for defamation while you are in prison.

## 2. The "One Phone Call" Policy
If you are arrested, you are legally entitled to one phone call. **Do not call me.** I will not answer.

## 3. No Refunds
Refunds are not issued if you ignore my advice and wear the neon ski mask anyway.

*Signed,*
