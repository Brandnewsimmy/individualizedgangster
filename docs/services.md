# Our Services

### The "Mask & Fit" Audit
You want to wear a neon green ski mask to a night robbery? Let’s workshop that. I’ll review your attire for visibility, DNA shedding potential, and general ridiculousness. **Includes a mandatory "Cover Your Neck" seminar for people with distinctive tattoos who think a bandana is enough.**

### The Social Media Scrub
I calculate the exact odds of you live-streaming your own arrest. If you have TikTok installed on your burner phone, I charge double. **If you have posted "Big moves coming soon 🤫💰" in the last 24 hours, I am already calling your parole officer.**

### The "Getaway" Reality Check
You plan to outrun a helicopter in a 2004 Honda Odyssey with a slipping transmission *and* a check engine light? I’ll run the numbers. The numbers say "No." **Service includes a "Fill The Tank" reminder text sent 15 minutes before departure.**

### Alibi Stress Testing
I sit in a chair and ask, "Where were you?" for three hours. If you cry, you aren't ready for the precinct. **Advanced tier: I check your Google Maps timeline history while you explain why you were definitely "at the movies".**

### The "Lyrics Review" Service
Thinking of dropping a mixtape detailing exactly who you shot, where, and with what caliber weapon? I will read your lyrics and highlight everything that is admissible in court. (Spoiler: It's the whole song).

### The "Cousin Ray-Ray" Vetting
Every crew has a weak link. Usually, it's your cousin who owes money to three different loan sharks and just bought a PS5 despite being "unemployed". I identify him so you can leave him at home.

### Asset Liquidation Consulting
So you stole a pallet of iPhones? Do you have a plan to sell them? Or are you just going to turn them on in your garage and wait for the SWAT team? I explain "IMEI blocking" and "Find My" tracking using colorful puppets.
