# Pre-Crime Consulting

### *I tell you it’s a bad idea before the judge does.*

Don't commit a felony until you've had a feasibility study. I review your heist plans, alibis, and getaway routes. If it’s stupid, I’ll tell you. (Spoiler: It’s usually stupid.)

## Why Hire Me?
* **Risk Assessment:** I calculate the exact probability of you tripping over a laser grid.
* **Wardrobe Consulting:** I ensure your disguise doesn't make you look like a traffic cone.
* **Reality Checks:** I remind you that real life is not *Ocean's Eleven*.

> **Current Status:** Not currently accepting clients who believe the Earth is flat. It complicates the getaway maps.
